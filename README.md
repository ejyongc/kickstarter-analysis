# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns"
Performed analysis on kickstart data to identify trends and make recommendations.  


# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
After coming very close to hitting her Kickstarter goal, Louise sparked an interested to learn more about the different outcomes of the theater kickstarter campaigns in relation to their launch date and goal size. 
In this project we analyze Kickstarter data with the goal to visualize the three different outcomes (successful, failed, and cancelled) of the campaigns in relation to the month they were launched in and their goal size.  

### Purpose
The purpose of this report is to help Louise determine when would be the best time of the year to launch a successful kickstarter campaign, as well as setting an attainable campaign goal.    

## Analysis and Challenges
The analysis of the kickstarter data was divided into two separate outcomes: 
    1. Theater Outcomes by Launch Date (Sheet 1)
    2. Outcomes Based Goals (Sheet 2)
    
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
In the first analysis, we pivoted the data to show the three different outcomes (successful, failed, and cancelled) for all Theater Kickstart campaigns against  their launch date. Our first challenge when pivoting the table was 



### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
